Revenue management (RM) involves managing capacity/inventory, demand, and pricing to optimize revenue. This project aims to demonstrate how a container leasing company could benefit from RM. The resources for a container leasing company are lease duration units (e.g., day or week depending on the companyâ€™s policy), and its products are all possible combinations of starting date and lease duration. For the given company, there are 200 products spreading over 4 tenors (1, 4, 8 and 16 weeks) and 50 starting options (50 weeks). Each lease week connects to the preceding and to the following weeks forming a linear network.
